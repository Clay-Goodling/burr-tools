In this directory you find a few examples. Keep in mind that the puzzle designs
are owned by their corresponding designers and that you need to ask them if you
want to produce one of them commercially. They all have been so kind and
allowed me to bundle them here with the program.
Each design also demonstrates some of the features of the program so I will
tell a few words to each of them.

AlPackino: Designed by Ronald Kint-Bruynseels
This puzzle shows how to properly make packing puzzles. You always should
include the box as a piece so that the program can also check, if the pieces
can be moved into the box. You can also see how to handle multiple identical
pieces. When looking at the solution it is useful to display the box as a
wire frame. This can be done by clicking at the blue rectangle at the lower end
of the tools. The rectangle with the 0.0 in it.

Draculas Dental Desaster: Designed by Ronald Kint-Bruynseels
This puzzle demonstrated the used of colour contraints. Halve of the end result
must be red and the other halve black. You can see the colours if you enable
the checkbox in the statusline at the bottom right.

Pelikan Burr: Designed by Dic Sonneveld
This is a _very_ high level burr. It takes 98 moves to get the first piece out
of the box. This is just a demonstration of what is possible.
