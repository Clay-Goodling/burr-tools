------------- Version 0.1.5 Jul 10 2005

- no editing of problem while solving

- assembler status in file contains version

- error message, when failed to load

- remove solutions when editing

- variable cubes are not allowed in piece shapes

- memory leaks, uninitialized variables, other misc. valgrind messages

- update interface when solution has anded and reenable everything


------------- Version 0.1.4 Jul 6 2005

- more agressive reduce, may take a bit longer but still faster than
the original one that took ages for some puzzles

- valgrind fixes for memory frees and uninitialized memory

- the assembly state can now be saved and resumed so you can top the
calculation save and resume where you left off the next day

- new disassembly engine that is much faster for complex puzzles but a
bit slower for simple to disassemble puzzles

- faster disassembler preparation making the disassembling for simple
problems much faster

- better voxel space drawing, including all edges

- voxel space can now also draw the constraint colors besides the shape
color

- add toggle button on a status bar to toggle between piece and
constraint color

- separator text size was sometimes calculates wrong

- add web adress to about dialog

- populate the status line with some information


------------- Version 0.1.3 Jun 26 2005

- buttons use up frame now

- doc update

- make it possible to stop while preparing the assembler, you just have
to wait for it to finish. Bevore that the stop button was ignored while
in preparation

- piece fit test speedup. This should improve preparation speed

- when selecting a shape in the list that lists the piece and the piece
count for the current problem, the corresponding piece gets selected

- about box

- problem renaming

- when something is not right with the puzzle a message box appears now
instad of a hang in the GUI

- set the z-layer of the shape editor to 0 on new shape
