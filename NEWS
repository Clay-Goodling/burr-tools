------------- Version 0.1.8

- when the program crashes it tries to show some information and it also
  tries to save the current puzzle into __rescue.xmpuzzle. Please follow 
  the instructions in this window and send me the information.

- when reducing show the piece that is worked on to show that something
  is going on

- Placement browser lets you see at what positions a certain piece fits
  into the resulting shape. Attention, read the documentation about this

- Documentation updates. Some of the internals are described

- Suppression of rotated and mirrored solutions. The program now
  wont find rotated and mirrored solutions any longer (at leat I hope
  that it does

- configuration file. The position of the window is saved, you can also
  toggle tooltips and switch off the light in 3D view resulting in a
  completely even and very light colors for the pieces

- better groupings. It is not possible to assign mutliple groups with a
  count to each (set of) pieces. The meaning is defined like this. There
  can be UP TO the specified number of pieces in this group. This is not
  required, but when needed it is used. This may be useful if you don't
  know which pieces belong to which group. Say you have a puzzle of n
  identical pieces and all you know is that it can be disassembled into 2
  groups but you don't know how large these groups are. Then you simply
  assign 2 groups to the pieces and in each of these 2 groups can go n-1
  pieces.

- add possibility to swap 3D view and edit grid in the shape edit tab.
  This gives you a bigger grid to edit bigger puzzles

- reverse meaning of the slider in the grid editor

- fix bug in minimise causing crash when executed on empty shapes

- solution selector can take the focus, so you can use the cursor keys
  to go through solutions

- some key-shortcuts: F4 toggles 3d and grid view, + and - change edit
layer, F2 saves and F3 loads a file

- sort solutions by number of moves required the completely disassemble

- show the complete number of moves required to disassembler, and the
  level of the puzzle

- cursor for 3D-View

- Variable cubes are now normal sized cubes with a black square

- remove a color deletion problem

- when the tab was dragged so that the 3D-view became invisible (0
  pixel width) the programm abborted

------------- Version 0.1.7 Aug 19 2005

- last version missed the placement optimisations for pieces
  resulting in an eternal solving time for some more complex
  puzzles like Bill Cuttlers SM or Lovley18. This version
  switches the optimisations back on, that makes some puzzles
  a bit slower but on the other hand the solving time for some
  complex puzzles drops down considerable (from years to hours)

- huge speedup for the disassembler for puzzles that have lots of
  assemblies for EasyLiving for example only 25% of the time is left
  (time dropped from 24 to 6 seconds) and also for complex puzzles like
  Pelikan Burr time dropped to 66% (from 5.5 to 3.6 seconds)

- new editing possibilities: drag to fill rectangles and a button that
  makes your changes not just to the current layer but to all

- add possibility to load PuzzleSolver3D filed (this can be done
  with the "Import" entry in the main menu

- add function to make it possible to not completely disassemble
  the puzzles. This is done by putting pieces into groups. All
  pieces that are in the same group can stay together and the
  puzzle is still considered as disassembled.
    Group 0 is different. All pieces in group 0 need to be
  taken apart until single. You can set the group for each piece
  with the G+ and G- buttons in the problem tab

- when puzzles where saved before a result shape was defined the
  program refused to load the file. This works now. Old filed
  can be loaded as well

- small correction to the 3d view. Cubes besides variable cubes had
  missing faces

------------- Version 0.1.6 Jul 10 2005

- add button to change color

- documentation update

- add a lot of comments

- make "just count" work

- enable time display and estimation

- thread fix for win 9x

- load of bad files no longer abborts program but show message

------------- Version 0.1.5 Jul 10 2005

- no editing of problem while solving

- assembler status in file contains version

- error message, when failed to load

- remove solutions when editing

- variable cubes are not allowed in piece shapes

- memory leaks, uninitialized variables, other misc. valgrind messages

- update interface when solution has anded and reenable everything


------------- Version 0.1.4 Jul 6 2005

- more agressive reduce, may take a bit longer but still faster than
the original one that took ages for some puzzles

- valgrind fixes for memory frees and uninitialized memory

- the assembly state can now be saved and resumed so you can top the
calculation save and resume where you left off the next day

- new disassembly engine that is much faster for complex puzzles but a
bit slower for simple to disassemble puzzles

- faster disassembler preparation making the disassembling for simple
problems much faster

- better voxel space drawing, including all edges

- voxel space can now also draw the constraint colors besides the shape
color

- add toggle button on a status bar to toggle between piece and
constraint color

- separator text size was sometimes calculates wrong

- add web adress to about dialog

- populate the status line with some information


------------- Version 0.1.3 Jun 26 2005

- buttons use up frame now

- doc update

- make it possible to stop while preparing the assembler, you just have
to wait for it to finish. Bevore that the stop button was ignored while
in preparation

- piece fit test speedup. This should improve preparation speed

- when selecting a shape in the list that lists the piece and the piece
count for the current problem, the corresponding piece gets selected

- about box

- problem renaming

- when something is not right with the puzzle a message box appears now
instad of a hang in the GUI

- set the z-layer of the shape editor to 0 on new shape

- bugfixes
