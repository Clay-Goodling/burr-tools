BurrTools is a library to solve burr-type puzzles. Bundled with the
library comes a graphical program that lets you edit the puzzles and
view the found solutions.

Later on BurrTools will also be able to help in designing new puzzles.

The real documentation is inside the executable-file as online help.
If you want you can export that help into a bunch of html and png files.

I've also been able to bundle a few puzzles with the program to
demonstrate its features. Thanks to the designers. You can find these
puzzles in the examples subdirectory.

Have fun.
