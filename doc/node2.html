What are B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>? B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> consists of two
main parts. On the one hand there is a program that assembles and disassembles
burr-type puzzles. That program contains a graphical user interface (GUI)
which allows creating and editing puzzle definitions, solving the puzzle, and
the display and animation of the solutions found. This is probably the most
interesting part for most people. On the other hand there is also a
C++ library that may help with the search for and design of new
puzzles. This library contains all the necessary tools to write programs that
do what the graphical interface does (and more).

<P>
The first part of this document describes the graphical program. It contains
descriptions of all concepts and explains how to use them in the GUI program.
The second section contains a description of the library and some internals.
Also, some of the algorithms used are explained. This section is probably
interesting only for people wanting to use the library for their own puzzle
design explorations.

<P>
But first a little bit of history of this program. There are already two
programs similar to B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> can do. One is
BCPB<SMALL>OX/</SMALL>G<SMALL>ENDA</SMALL> written by Bill Cutler. Cutler's programs are very
versatile, they even can handle space grids different from cubes. The other
one is P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D by Andr&#233; van Kammen. I had bought this
program a while ago and have generally been quite satisfied with it. I have
taken over quite some ideas from the GUI that Andr&#233; developed. So why
another program, you might ask. Here are a few reasons:
<OL>
<LI>The available programs are not for L<SMALL>INUX</SMALL>, which is my
  operating system of choice,
<LI>the available programs are binary only programs and hence it is quite
  hard to do more complex research or design tasks,
<LI>the programs do cost money,
<LI>P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D seems to be abandoned. There hasn't been any
  update for quite a while, and
<LI>P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D has some nasty limits to the shape, sizes,
  and the number of possible placements.
</OL>

Anyway, I was not completely satisfied with the available software. Then in
summer 2003 a German computer magazine started a competition to write a
program that counts the number of solutions to a merchandising puzzle as fast
as possible. My program wasn't the fastest but it was the starting point for
the B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>.

<P>
As there are many people out there that are a lot more creative than I am and
that could use a program like this to design nice puzzles, I decided to make
it public and free (see www.guu.org).

<P>
I added a GUI that can work on many operating systems, including
L<SMALL>INUX</SMALL> and W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL>. This has the disadvantage that the
GUI looks a bit different from what the normal W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL> user is used
to, so stay calm if things look a bit unusual, they behave in fact quite
similar to how a normal W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL>-program behaves.

<P>
Lately 2 people played important roles in the development of the program.
These 2 are Ronald Kint-Bruynseels and Derek Bosch. Ronald has rewritten the
first part of this manual and has generally contributed lots of well organized
suggestions. Derek is responsible for the OSX port of the program. Without him
there would be no binary for this operating system available.

<P>
I want to thank both of them for their work. I also want to thank all the
other people that have sent in bug reports, suggestions and praise. Their
input is very welcome and crucial to the further development of the program.

<P>
All this work has taken many years to reach the current state, I hope it was
worth it and that you have a lot of fun with the program.
