<P>
B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> comes with some extra features to assist you in making
  puzzle solution sheets, either for your personal archives or to be issued
  with your exchange puzzles and commercially produced puzzles. Currently,
  these capabilities are very basic and need to be improved in a future update
  of the program. So, don't expect too much from them right now, but rather
  consider them to be merely a preview of comming attractions.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02610000000000000000"></A><A NAME="AddingComments"></A>Adding Comments</H1>

<P>
The <I><B>Edit Comment</B></I> entry on the menu bar opens a new
  window that allows you to add textual information to the puzzle file. It can
  be used to append extra information such as the name of the designer, or a
  'to do' list for your own designs.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02620000000000000000"></A><A NAME="ExportingImages"></A>Exporting Images</H1>

<P>
The <I><B>Export - Images</B></I> entry on the menu opens a window
  that allows you to export a portion of the current puzzle to (a list of)
  images (see Figure <A HREF="#FigureImageExport">ImageExport</A>).
  On the right the window has a 3D
  view, and on the left it has input elements that control what is being
  created. On the very bottom of these controls you can select what you want
  to create images of. Depending on what is present in the puzzle, the
  following things can be exported:

<CENTER>  
<A NAME="FigureImageExport"></A><A NAME="1848"></A>
<IMG SRC="Window_ImageExport.png"><BR>
<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG>The image export window
</CENTER>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Shape</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An image of a single shape (a shape that was made on the
    entities tab) is created. You can select which shape with the shape
    selector below.</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Problem</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An image containing all shapes that are used for a problem
    is created. Again you will find the problem selector below that is used to
    select which problem you are going to create images of.</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Assembly</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An image showing the positions of the pieces in an
    assembly is created. You can select the problem. The first assembly of
    that problem is exported.</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Solution</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An image containing all steps necessary to disassemble a
    problem is created. In this case you also select the problem with the
    selector below. The images will be created for the last solution of that
    problem.</DD>
</DL>

<P>
What to export is the first thing that you have to select. Naturally only
  the choices are available for which the puzzle has data. So if you have not
  run the solver on the current puzzle, it is impossible to export solutions
  or assemblies.

<P>
Above these selectors you find the file output parameters. First the name
  and the path to where the images are supposed to be created. If you give no
  path, the images are put into the working directory of the program. The file
  name is just a prefix, so if you keep 'test' as file name you get files of
  the form 'test000.png', 'test001.png', ... . (B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>
  creates only PNG image files)

<P>
Finally, you can say how many images you intend to create.
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> will try to do so, but might use less. If you only have
  one assembly to export, only one page can be created. The <I>Number
  of images</I> entry is ignored by the software for the time being, it will be
  used later on.

<P>
Above these input elements you find the last section that defines your
  output. Here you can define the quality and some additional parameters that
  influence how the images look, but not what is to be seen.

<P>
In the top left corner you find the definition of the background of the
  image. You can choose between transparent or white. Transparent is useful if
  you want to have a background with patterns or want to further edit the
  images.

<P>
Below you find the settings for the oversampling factor. The higher that is,
  the smoother the images will look, but the more memory and calculation time
  is required.

<P>
Below you can choose whether you want to use the constraint colours for the
  output or rather the default colour of the shapes.

<P>
The checkbox <I>Dim static pieces</I> makes B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> draw
  pieces that are not involved in the current move in a lighter colour, so
  that the pieces actually moving are easier to spot. This, of course, only
  works when exporting solutions.

<P>
Finally there are the parameters for the image size that the program
  creates. There are 2 choices: either define the pixel size directly, or
  define the size of the image in millimetres and the DPI printer resolution.
  If you want to create A4 or letter sized images for printing, you can use
  the predefined sizes.

<P>
To position the shapes in the output images, you can use the 3D view at the
  right of the export window. All images exported will use the same settings
  for angle and zoom as in that 3D view. If the shapes reach above or below
  the 3D view they will be trimmed. Left and right is different. The width of
  the images to generate is not fixed. So the program will make them quite a
  bit wider to accommodate the horizontal spread of the pieces.

<P>
When you have finished with all settings, press <I>Export Image(s)</I>.
  You will see a flurry of images in the 3-D view. The program draws
  the shapes there and grabs the content from the display. This may take a
  while. First the size of the images is determined, then the images are drawn
  in the required high resolution for the output. The progress can be seen on
  the left beside the 2 buttons. You will see how many images are finished and
  how many there are overall.

<P>
Hint: If you get unexpected results and broken images, try to do nothing
  while the images are exported. On Linux it is forbidden to change the
  virtual desktop because then nothing is drawn.

<P>
The export facilities are far from what we want them to be, many important
  features are missing, so you can expect some progress in later versions of
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>.
  
<H1><A NAME="SECTION02625000000000000000"></A><A NAME="ExportingVectorImages"></A>Exporting Vector Images</H1>

<P>
As well as the bitmap images explained in the section above B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>
can also export vector images in various different formats. These images have the advantage
of beeing freely scalable without loss of precision.

The vector image export doesn't have functionality to export a complete assembly or disassembly
sequence, but only one image. The image exported is the one currently visible in the 3D view.

To export that display into a vecotr image select <I>Vector Image</I> from the <I>Export</I>
menu. A small window will open which lets you select the possible image format and the filename.
You have to append the right extension to the filename on your own.

The export may take a while (a few seconds up to a minute or so) and within that time the application
is unresponsive so please be patient.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02630000000000000000"></A><A NAME="ExportingSTL"></A>Exporting to STL</H1>

<P>
STL, which stands for Standard Triangulation Language or Standard
  Tesselation Language is a file format used by stereolithography software.
  STL-Files describe the surface of 3-dimensional objects.
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> can export single shapes into STL files so that 3D
  printers can quickly fabricate prototypes of them.

<P>
The main menu entry <I><B>Export - STL</B></I> opens the window
seen in Figure <A HREF="#stlexportwindow">StlExportWindow</A>. 
The window has shape selector, a
  3-D view of the selected shape and some parameters that control
  the shapes created. The exact parameters depend on the grid of the
  current puzzle.

<CENTER>
<A NAME="stlexportwindow"></A><A NAME="1855"></A>
<IMG SRC="Window_StlExport.png"><BR>
<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG>The STL-Export window
</CENTER>

<P>
<I><B>Filename</B></I> and <I><B>Path</B></I> control
  the name and position of the generated file. <I><B>Cube
  Size</B></I> controls the base length of the created cubes.
  <I><B>Bevel</B></I> controls the size of the bevel and
  <I><B>Shrink</B></I> allows a gap between the pieces, so that it
  is actually possible to assemble them. If the shapes were made to correct
  sizes they would touch, making movement impossible.
<P>
For spheres the parameters are as follows:

<UL>
    <LI><I><B>Sphere radius:</B></I> controls the gap between the
    centers of the single spheres. It also is the maximum radius
    the spheres can have. This value is in output units
    <LI><I><B>Connection radius:></B></I> controls the radius the
    connection of the spheres has. As the spheres mathematically only
    touch in one point connectors need to be added. Those connectors
    are cylinders. The radius of those cylinders can maximally be so
    that they touch one another. If this value is 1 then the cylinders
    have their maximal radius, 0 would mean no connection
    <LI><I><B>Curvature radius:</B></I> controls the radius of the
    transition between sphere surface and cylinder surface. If this
    value is 0 no transition is done and there will be a bend in the
    surface. If the value is 1 the maximally possible area will be used
    to go from sphere surface to cylinder syrface. When there is only
    little or no space for the transition (e.g. when the connection
    radius is close to 1) there might be a bend, even when this value
    is close to 1.
    <LI><I><B>Offset:</B></I> just like with the cubes this makes the
    spheres smaller to make the puzzle actually assembable. This is in
    output units. Keep the values small if you want to have working
    puzzles.
    <LI><I><B>Recursions:</B></I> controls the number of used triangles
    to approximate the surfaces. A value one bigger will reslt in
    approximately 4 times as many triangles and accordingly smoother
    surface. Don't make it too big!
</UL>

<P>
The STL-Export right now works only for cubes and shperes. Triangles and
the rhombic grid are not supported.
Also the shapes to export must not contain any variable voxels.
