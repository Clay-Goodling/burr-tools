The first part of this user guide is written from a <EM>procedural</EM>

their functions, this manual guides you through the program the way you should
create your first design. Terms may be briefly repeated at several places in
the text.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02121000000000000000">Downloading BurrTools</A></H2>

<P>
B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> is an <EM>Open Source</EM> software project. The most
recent release of the program is always available for <EM>free</EM> download
at the B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> website:

<P>
<CENTER><TT>http://burrtools.sourceforge.net</TT></CENTER>

<P>
At the bottom of that page you can select the proper download for
your operating system. This will bring you to the download page where you have
to select a mirror site to start the downloading. It's highly recommended to
select the mirror site on the server nearest to your location.

<P>
M<SMALL>ICROSOFT </SMALL>W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL> users can download either the <TT>Windows
Binary</TT> (a zipped file which needs manual extraction and installation) or the
self-extracting <TT>Windows Installer</TT>. Unless you have a slow
connection to the internet, downloading the installer is probably the best
option. To use B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> on a U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL> platform you have to
download the <TT>Source</TT> files and compile the program on your system
(see installation guidelines below). An OSX package is provided.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02122000000000000000">Installation of BurrTools</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION02122100000000000000">Microsoft Windows</A></H3>

<P>
If you downloaded the <TT>Widows Binary</TT>, just extract the file into the
directory of your choice and the GUI is ready to be used. If you opted for the
<TT>Windows Installer</TT>, start the executable and follow the instructions
on your screen.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION02122200000000000000">Mac OS X</A></H3>

<P>
For detailed installation instructions please refer to the manual or help
files of your operating system.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION02122300000000000000">Linux / Unix</A></H3>

<P>
These installation instructions just contain some hints for the compilation of
B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>. As B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> requires a few not so widespread
libraries it is not the easiest task to do this.

<P>
To install B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> for U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL> you first need to make
sure you have the following libraries installed: <TT>zlib</TT>,
<TT>libpng</TT>, <TT>libxml2</TT> and <TT>libxslt</TT>. These libraries
are usually installed on every L<SMALL>INUX</SMALL> system. You just have to make
sure that you have installed the development packages, otherwise it is not
possible to compile a program that uses these libraries, but just start
programs that use them.

<P>
Additionally the following libraries are required: <TT>flkt</TT> and
<TT>xmlwrapp</TT>.

<P>
<TT>Fltk</TT> is the library used for the GUI of B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>. It
may be included in your L<SMALL>INUX</SMALL> distribution or it may not.

<P>
The problem is that we need a version of this library that is not compiled
with the default switches. This library must be compiled with C++ exceptions
enabled. If you don't do this the program will simply shut down when an
internal error occurs instead of displaying an error message and making an
emergency save. To compile <TT>flkt</TT> with exceptions enabled you have to
do the following:

<UL>
<LI>Download and decompress as usual
<LI>Run <TT>configure</TT> just as usual
<LI>Remove <TT>-fno-exceptions</TT> from the file <TT>makeinclude</TT>
<LI>Finish normally by calling <TT>make</TT> and <I><TT>make install</TT></I>
</UL>

It is of course possible to use a normal version of the <TT>fltk</TT>
library, you just don't get the emergency save feature if there is a bug in
the GUI of B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>. But as the number of bugs is hopefully quite
small right now that should not be such a big problem.

<P>
The last library, <TT>xmlwrapp</TT>, can be hard to find, so here is a link

<P>
<CENTER><TT>xmlwrapp.sf.net</TT></CENTER>

<P>
This library is compiled and installed in the usual Unix way, read their
installation documentation.

<P>
Now B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> can be compiled and installed the usual way with
<TT>configure</TT>, <TT>make</TT>, <TT>make install</TT>.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02123000000000000000">Files and Folders</A></H2>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02130000000000000000">Concepts and Definitions</A></H1>

<P>
Before we start describing the functions of B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>, let's
synchronise our use of vocabulary and explain a few concepts that are crucial
to the way B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> works.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02131000000000000000"></A><A NAME="Definitions"></A>Definitions</H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Voxel</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A voxel <EM>(volume pixel)</EM> is a space unit in the
  3-D space. The shape of the voxels is defined by the space grid
  type. Currently B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> supports cubic voxels, triangular
  prisms and tightly packed spheres. Each voxel has one of the following three
  states: <EM>Empty</EM>, <EM>Fixed</EM> (<EM>Filled</EM>) and
  <EM>Variable</EM> (&rarr; <A HREF="#Concepts">Concepts</A>). Additionally each
  voxel can also contain supplementary information in the form of colours that
  are attached to the whole or parts of that voxel. Currently
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> can only attach one single colour to the voxel as a
  whole.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Spacegrid</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The spacegrid defines the shape and orientation and
  arrangement of the voxels. Right now there are 3 space grids available in
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>: cubes, prisms with a equilateral triangle as base, and
  tightly packed spheres. Spacegrids are always fixed and periodic. That means
  that a voxel in a certain position will always have the same shape and
  orientation. So a spacegrid defining, for example, all Penrose patterns is
  not possible because these are neither a fixed nor a periodic patterns.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Shape</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is a definition of a 3-dimensional object.
  Shapes are assembled out of voxels.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Piece</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A piece is a shape that is used as a part of the puzzle.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Multipiece</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Some pieces may have the same shape. B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>
  requires you to tell it that two or more pieces do have the same shape,
  otherwise it will find all solutions with all permutations. So a multipiece
  is a piece that's used more than once in the problem.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Group (also Piece Group)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A collection of pieces (and/or multipieces)
  than can move with respect to each other, but cannot be separated from one
  another. Denoted with {}.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Result</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the shape that the pieces of the puzzle are supposed
  to assume once the puzzle is assembled.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Problem</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A problem in B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> consists of a list of
  pieces and/or multipieces, a result shape and possibly some constraints. You
  can have more than one problem in a file, as it may be possible to have more
  than a single task with the same set of pieces (e.g. Piet Hein's
  S<SMALL>OMA </SMALL>C<SMALL>UBE</SMALL>). In other words, a problem is a statement about
  <EM>what to do</EM> with the pieces.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Puzzle</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A puzzle is either a single problem or a collection of
  problems.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Identifier</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A unique code to identify a shape, colour or problem. This
  consists of an automatically assigned prefix to which a custom name may be
  added. The prefix is already unique. It is a letter followed by a number.
  The letter is different for all items that required identifiers, e.g. it is
  S for shapes, P for problems and C for colours.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Assembly</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An assembly is a physically possible arrangement of pieces
  (meaning the pieces do not overlap in space) so that the resulting shape is
  formed. It is not guaranteed that it is actually possible to get the pieces
  into the positions of the assembly without using advanced technologies like
  Star Trek beaming.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Solution</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A Solution is an assembly with instructions how to
  assemble/disassemble the pieces.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Assembler</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The part of the program or algorithm that tries to assemble
  the puzzle.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Disassembler</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The part of the program that tries to find out how the
  pieces must be moved to assemble the puzzle. It does this by trying to
  disassemble an assembly. Some puzzles like P<SMALL>ENTOMINOES</SMALL> don't
  require separate instruction how to assemble the pieces. It suffices to know
  where the pieces are in the assembly. Other puzzles require detailed
  instructions how to move the pieces to assemble the final shape. That is why
  the task of finding the assemblies and creating assembly/disassembly
  instructions are separated from one another.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Solver</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A short name to refer to the assembler and disassembler as a
  unit or just one of these without specifying which one.
</DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02132000000000000000"></A><A NAME="Concepts"></A><BR>Concepts</H2>

<P>
As described above, B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> works with shapes which are merely a
collection of voxels that each can have either one of three different states:
<EM>empty</EM>, <EM>fixed</EM> or <EM>variable</EM>. Particularly the
difference between fixed and variable voxels has a great impact on the way the
solver works and which assemblies are considered to be valid and which are
not. Besides that, the validity of solutions can be further restricted by
imposing colour constraints.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION02132100000000000000">Voxel States</A></H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Empty</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The empty state is rather superfluous as it can also be
  regarded as the absence of any voxel. It is just used in the result shape to
  indicate the spots that can't be filled at all (holes).
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Fixed (or Normal)</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The normal or fixed voxels <EM>need to be
  filled</EM> in the final result, otherwise it is not considered to be a valid
  assembly.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Variable</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The variable state is used to instruct the program that for
  a particular voxel it is unknown whether it will be filled or empty in the
  final assembly. This is required for puzzles that have holes in
  <EM>undetermined</EM> places (like all the higher level six-piece burrs).
  All voxels that <EM>might</EM> be empty <EM>must</EM> have the variable
  state in the result shape. Right now the variable state can only be used in
  result shapes and the solver will pop up an error message whenever it
  encounters a variable state in a normal piece.
<BR>
Later on variable voxels might be used in piece shapes as well to define
  voxels in the shape that the program might alter to create interesting
  puzzles.
</DD>
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION02132200000000000000">Colour Constraints</A></H3>

<P>
Colours allow you to add constraints to the possible placement of pieces. This
is done by assigning a colour to one or more voxels of the piece(s) and the
result shape (&rarr;<A HREF="node6.html#AddingColour">AddingColour</A>). Then you can set some
colour placement conditions for each problem
(&rarr;<A HREF="node7.html#ColourConstraints">ColourConstraints</A>). The program will place pieces
only at positions that fulfil the colour conditions defined.

<P>
These colour conditions currently allow the definition of what coloured voxels
of the pieces may go into what coloured voxels in the result shape. The
<EM>default colour</EM> is special: it always makes a color match. Voxels in a
piece that are in the default colour fit everywhere and default coloured
voxels in the result shape can accommodate any piece voxel, independent of its
custom colour.

<P>
Currently the assigned colour is interpreted as painting the whole voxel with
this colour, but in the future more advanced possibilities for colouring and
conditions may be added.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02140000000000000000"></A><A NAME="PS3DUsers"></A><BR>Notes for PuzzleSolver3D Users</H1>

<P>
B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> was initially very much based on
P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D by Andr&#233; van Kammen but, by now has diverged quite
a bit from that. We strongly advise you to read this user guide since there
are some features in B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> that work somewhat differently to
their counterparts in P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D and there are also some
functions that PuzzleSolver3D doesn't have. Below are the most prominent
differences that need your attention:

<OL>
<LI>B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> doesn't handle holes automatically as
  P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D does. This may at first sound like a disadvantage
  but in fact it isn't. Unless you select <EM>'Outer limits of result must
  be filled'</EM> on the solve tab, P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D treats all cubes of
  the target shape as cubes that might be filled but don't need to be. But
  knowing which cubes <EM>must</EM> be filled speeds up the search process.
  The more there are of these (as compared to the total number of cubes), the
  faster the solver will run, as fewer possibilities are left to test.
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> requires you to specify exactly which cubes in the
  result shape must be filled and which ones may be empty.

<LI>The B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> solver doesn't automatically detect multiple
  identical pieces. You need to specify if a piece is used more than once. If
  you just copy them the way you do in P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D the program
  will find way too many solutions. For example, with Bruce Love's
  L<SMALL>OVELY 18 </SMALL>P<SMALL>IECE </SMALL>B<SMALL>URR</SMALL> it will find nearly 40,000,000 times as many
  solutions as there really are. So be careful.

<LI>B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> allows you to define multiple problems in a
  single session. So you can, for example, save all the S<SMALL>OMA </SMALL>C<SMALL>UBE</SMALL>
  (Piet Hein) problems within one single file.

<LI>B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> has no limits to the number and size of pieces.
  You can have as many pieces as you want and they are not confined to a grid
  of 24x24x24.

<LI>There is no limit to the number of possible positions for the pieces.
  So B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> won't stop and complain about too many placements.
  As long as your computer has sufficient memory the program will merrily
  continue working - even if it would take longer than the universe exists -
  to complete the search.

<LI>B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> supports another gridspace besides the cube space
  supported by P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D. This allows the design and analysis
  of completely new puzzles

<LI>B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> knows piece ranges, which enables you to search
for puzzles and not just solve them.

</OL>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02141000000000000000">Importing P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D files</A></H2>

<P>
B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> has capabilities for <EM>importing</EM>
P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D files. So there's no need to redo your designs from
scratch, although some postediting may be required because of the differences
in handling duplicates of pieces and holes in the puzzle.

<P>
There are 2 possibilities for the holes. Depending on whether the option
``Fill outer Cubes'' is enabled or not when you solve the puzzle with
P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D, you must either make the inner cubes of the result
shape or the whole shape variable if you want to get the same results with
B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>. This can be done with the tools described in section
<A HREF="node6.html#ChapterConstrainingTools">ConstrainingTools</A>. With these tools you can make a shapes inner
or outer cubes variable.

<P>
The duplicate pieces are handled automatically. B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> adds all
shapes to the new puzzle but does not add duplicates to the problem instead
the counter for the original is increased. The unused shapes are marked as
unused and can be deleted if they are not required.
