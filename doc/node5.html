<P>
When BurrTools is started for the very first time the GUI will look like
Figure <A HREF="#FigureMainWindowStart">MainWindowStart</A> which shows the main window. Although
some small variations may occur depending on your operating system, screen
resolution, and display preferences settings. The GUI has four major parts. On
top there is a <EM>menu bar</EM> that allows handling of files and offers
extra functionality as well as some preferences settings for the program. At
the bottom there is a traditional <EM>status bar</EM> presenting relevant
information about the task at hand. In between there is a <EM>tools
section</EM> on the left and a <EM>3-D viewport</EM> on the right.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02210000000000000000">The BurrTools Menus</A></H1>

<P>
Below is a brief overview of the main menu entries with references to the
places in the text where a more detailed explanation is provided.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><I>File</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This menu holds the procedures for handling files
  within B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> and for exiting the program
  (&rarr;<A HREF="#FileMenu">File Menu</A>).
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>Toggle 3-D</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Swaps the 2-D and the 3-D
  grids for the <I>Entities</I> tab (&rarr;).
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>Export</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Contains a submenu with 2 entries. One allows you
  to export the contents of the 3-D viewer that can be used to
  create high quality solution sheets
  (&rarr;<A HREF="node9.html#ExportingImages">ExportingImages</A>). The other allows you to create
  STL files for 3-D printers (&rarr;
<A HREF="node9.html#ExportingSTL">Exporting to STL</A>)
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>Grid Parameters</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This menu entry will allow you to change
  parameters for the currently used space grid. These parameters include
  things like scaling of axes or skew. Not all space grids support parameters.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>Status</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This opens up a window containing lots of possibly
  useful information about the shapes of the puzzles
  (&rarr;
<A HREF="node6.html#ChapterStatus">Chapter Status</A>).
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>Edit Comment</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Allows appending textual information to the
  puzzle file (&rarr;
<A HREF="node9.html#AddingComments">Adding Comments</A>).
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>Config</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This menu item provides some preferences settings
  (&rarr;
<A HREF="#ConfigMenu">Config Menu</A>).
</DD>

<DT><STRONG><I>About</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Shows a window with some information about the
program.
</DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02211000000000000000"></A><A NAME="FileMenu"></A>The File Menu</H2>

<P>
The <I><B>File</B></I> menu has all the traditional entries for
  handling files. Many of these are well known from other software and don't
  need much explanation. Some of the items also have keyboard shortcuts as
  indicated in the menus. Prior to executing most of these commands a warning
  (and option to cancel) is given whenever changes to the current design
  haven't been saved yet.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><I>New</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Starts a new design after removing all the
    information of the current one. The first thing that happens when you
    start a new puzzle is that you will be asked which spacegrid to use. When
    B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> is started it defaults to using the cubes spacegrid,
    so if you want to use another grid you need to use this menu.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Load</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Opens a B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> <TT>*.xmpuzzle</TT>
    file. A notification will pop up when a <EM>partially</EM> solved design
    is loaded. Short cut: <TT>[F3]</TT>.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Import</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This entry opens a traditional file dialogue that
    allows importing P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D files (<TT>*.puz</TT>) into
    B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS.</SMALL> Although these imported designs often can be
    subjected to the solver right away, some postediting may be required
    because of the differences in the way B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> handles holes
    in the result and duplicated pieces. BurrTools will import <EM>all</EM>
    the pieces from the <TT>*.puz</TT> file and assign them to the shapes S1
    to S<EM>n</EM>-1. Accordingly, the <EM>result</EM> from the
    P<SMALL>UZZLE</SMALL>S<SMALL>OLVER3</SMALL>D file will be assigned to the last shape
    (S<EM>n</EM>). Also a problem definition is automatically created
    (&rarr; Chapter <A HREF="node7.html#ChapterPuzzles">Puzzles</A>).

<P>
Since all imported shapes consist only of fixed voxels, the
    result shape may need some editing (puzzles that have internal holes or
    pieces not filling the outskirts of the result shape) to make the solver
    run. Also, duplicated pieces should preferably be deleted from the
    <I>Shapes</I> list (&rarr; <A HREF="node6.html#CreatingShapes">Creating Shapes</A>) but
    certainly from the <I>Piece Assignment</I> list
    (&rarr; <A HREF="node7.html#PieceAssignment">Piece assignment</A>), otherwise B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>
    will find way too many solutions (as it will distinguish all permutations
    of these identical pieces).
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Save</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Saves your work into a <TT>*.xmpuzzle</TT> file.
    If the design had not been saved before (indicated with
    '<TT>Unknown</TT>' in the BurrTools windows title bar) the
    <I>Save As</I> command will be activated. Short cut: <TT>[F2]</TT>.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Save As</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Allows you to save any changes to a new file,
    thus keeping the original design the way it was.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Quit</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Shuts down B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS.</SMALL>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Except when the solver is actually <EM>running</EM>, saving your work is
  always possible. This means that after stopping (pausing) the solver it is
  possible to save the results found thus far. Later on these partially solved
  puzzles can be loaded again and the solving process may be resumed. This
  allows you to subject 'huge' problems (e.g. 25 Y-pentominoes in a
  5x5x5 cube assembly) to B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> and have them
  solved in several sessions overnight or whenever you don't need your
  computer for other tasks.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02212000000000000000"></A><A NAME="ConfigMenu"></A>The Configuration Menu</H2>

<P>
The <I><B>Config</B></I> item on the menu bar opens a new window
  (Figure <A HREF="#FigureConfig">Config</A>) to set some options for the GUI. These
  settings will be stored in a file that is either in your home directory
  (U<SMALL>NIX</SMALL>) or in your profile (W<SMALL>INDOWS</SMALL>). The program will
  use these settings each time it is started.

<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG>The configuration window
</CENTER>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><I>Use openGL display lists</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option enables an optimisation for the 3-D viewer which makes it faster
    when drawing complex shapes. Sadly it seems to be that some OpenGL implementations
    don't properly support that option. So when you experience crashes when you edit
    shapes or rotate something in the 3-D view, try disabling this option.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Fade Out Pieces</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option affects the way pieces that
    <EM>become</EM> <EM>separated</EM> from the rest are depicted. Hence, the
    effects are visible only after running the solver
    (&rarr; <A HREF="node8.html#VisibilityOfPieces">Visibility of Pieces</A>).
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Use Lights in 3D View</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option toggles the use of a
    spotlight in the 3-D viewer. When disabled, the items in the
    3-D viewport get a uniform (high) illumination, whereas enabling
    this option provides a more rendered appearance of the objects by adding a
    spotlight in the upper right corner of the 3-D viewport and
    shading the faces of the objects. However, on some systems this may result
    in a relatively dark left bottom corner that can hamper a clear view of
    the objects.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>Use Tooltips</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>By default B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> shows
    tooltips for most of its controls, but to the more experienced user these
    soon become very annoying. This option allows you to switch these tooltips
    off.
</DD>
</DL>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02220000000000000000">The Status Bar</A></H1>

<P>
The status bar has two parts. On the left is given information about the
  task at hand, and on the right are some tools to alter the 3-D
  view. Currently you can select there <EM>how</EM> the 3-D view
  shows the shapes. You have the choice between the normal view where each
  piece is drawn with its default colour, or a view where each piece is drawn
  with its colour constraint colour (if it has one
  assigned &rarr; <A HREF="node6.html#AddingColour">Adding Colour</A>). The third option is an
  anaglyph called mode (see figure <A HREF="#WindowAnaglyph">Window Anaglyph</A>). In this mode the pieces are drawn using
  the red-cyan method to display real 3-D. You can view these with a
  red-green, red-blue, or red-cyan glasses. The <EM>r</EM>ed glass must be in
  front of your <EM>r</EM>ight eye.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02230000000000000000">The Tools Section</A></H1>

<P>
In between the menu bar and the status line is the most important part of
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL>: The section that allows you to submit existing puzzles
  to the solver, but more even important lets you create and test your own
  designs.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02231000000000000000">The Puzzle People</A></H2>

<P>
The tools section has three major tabs that might can be thought of by
  analogy with real people in the world of mechanical puzzles. First there is
  the <I>Entities</I> tab, which can be seen as the craftsman who
  <EM>creates</EM> different <EM>shapes</EM> but is not concerned with their
  purpose of these (&rarr;
Chapter <A HREF="node6.html#ChapterShapes">Shapes</A>). As long
  as his saw blade is sharp he's the happiest man in the whole wide world.
  Next, we have the <I>Puzzle</I> tab. This is the weirdo who thinks it's
  fun to come up with completely insane <EM>problems</EM> to be solved with
  the otherwise very innocent objects produced by our craftsman
  (&rarr;
Chapter <A HREF="node7.html#ChapterPuzzles">Puzzles</A>). However, his contribution
  to the preservation of our planet is considerable... by saving a lot of wood
  scraps from the incinerator. And last we have the <I>Solver</I>, the
  poor guy who spends not only a great deal of his money on these finely
  crafted puzzles but almost all of his leisure time on <EM>solving</EM> them
  (&rarr;
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#ChapterSolver">Solver</A>), only to feel very euphoric
  when he finally succeeds. But scientists are still breaking their heads over
  the question whether this is caused by the sweet smell of success, or is
  merely due to severe sleep deprivation.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02232000000000000000">Resizing the Elements</A></H2>

<P>
Although the layout of the GUI is designed to suit the needs of most users,
  it sometimes may be useful to resize some elements for convenience in using
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS.</SMALL> Besides the traditional resizing of the main window,
  B<SMALL>URR</SMALL>T<SMALL>OOLS</SMALL> has a couple of features to alter the relative
  importance of its controls.

<P>
First, the tools tabs can be made wider or narrower (thus making the
  3-D viewport more or less important) by dragging the right edge of
  the tools section. Hovering your mouse pointer over that edge will make it
  change into a left-right arrow, indicating that you can start dragging it.

<P>
Second, within each of the three main tabs some sections (panels) can be
  resized as well. For example, if you have a design with many different
  shapes but no colour constraints at all, reducing the size of all colour
  related controls and maximising those concerning shapes could be very
  advantageous. The panels on the tool tabs are separated by so called resize
  handles (Figure
 <A HREF="#FigureResize">Resize</A>). The separators that allow resizing are
  easily recognised by a little beveled square on their right end. Hover your
  mouse pointer over the lines until it changes into an up-down arrow,
  indicating that you can drag the separator up or down to resize the panel.
  
<CENTER>
<A NAME="FigureResize"></A><A NAME="1529"></A>
<IMG SRC="SizeBar.png"><BR>
<STRONG>Figure:</STRONG>Resize handles
</CENTER>

<P>
Note that each section has a minimum size. It is not possible to make it
  smaller than that minimum size.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION02240000000000000000">The 3-D Viewer</A></H1>

<P>
Normally the biggest part of the GUI is reserved for the 3-D
  viewport. In fact this 3-D viewer is threefold and has different
  properties for each of the tabs of the tools section. For the
  <I>Entities</I> tab the 3-D viewport shows the currently
  selected shape and reflects all editing operations performed on that shape.
  Also the x-, y- and z-axes are shown to assist navigating in
  space. With the <I>Puzzle</I> tab activated an overview of the current
  problem is presented: the result shape (double sized) on top and a single
  instance of each shape used as pieces below it. Finally, for the
  <I>Solver</I> tab, the 3-D viewer can be used to browse all
  assemblies found and/or show an animation of the moves involved in the
  disassembly of the puzzle.

<P>
Any object in the 3-D view can be <EM>rotated</EM> by simply
  dragging it, and the scrollbar on the right allows <EM>zooming</EM> in or
  out on that object by respectively moving the slider down or up. Note that
  the zoom settings are independent for each of the three tools tabs.

<P>
Extra options for the 3-D viewer are available in the
  <I>Config</I> menu (&rarr; <A HREF="#ConfigMenu">Config Menu</A>).
